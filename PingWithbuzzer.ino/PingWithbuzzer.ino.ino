/*
  Ping))) Sensor

  This sketch reads a PING))) ultrasonic rangefinder and returns the distance
  to the closest object in range. To do this, it sends a pulse to the sensor to
  initiate a reading, then listens for a pulse to return. The length of the
  returning pulse is proportional to the distance of the object from the sensor.

  The circuit:
	- +V connection of the PING))) attached to +5V
	- GND connection of the PING))) attached to ground
	- SIG connection of the PING))) attached to digital pin 7
